        <p>acred to goddess Parvati, Hiranyakeshi Temple is the point from where Hiranyakeshi river originates. In the main sanctum of the temple, there is an idol of Devi Hiranyakeshi (a form of Goddess Parvati) with golden hair and self-manifested red color Shivling called as Hiranyakeshwar. The lingam is not visible as an another Shivling, which is used for daily offerings and prayers, is overshadowing it. The temple is located amidst the lush forest but reaching here is not a problem as there are well-built roads.

            Adjacent to the temple, there is a cave, which is said to be the point where the Hiranyakeshi river originates. Water rushes out with tremendous force to fall into a ‘Kund’ (tank), from where it further flows out.</p>
