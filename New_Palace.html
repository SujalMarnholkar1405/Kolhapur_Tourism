        <p>History and Architecture:
            The palace was commissioned by Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, the 5th Chhatrapati of the Kolhapur princely state. 
            Construction took 7 years, from 1877 to 1884, and cost approximately seven lakh rupees. 
            It's an excellent example of Indian architecture, built with black polished stone. 
            The palace is eight-angled with a central tower, and the clock on the tower was installed in 1877. 
            The Darbar Hall features stained glass depictions from Shivaji's life and intricately carved columns.
