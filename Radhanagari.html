        <p>Radhanagari Dam, is a gravity dam on Bhogawati river near Radhanagari in the state of Maharashtra in India. Construction was initiated by visionary Rajarshi Shahu on 18 February 1907.[2] The dam is being used for irrigation as well as hydro-electricity. The dam is located amidst scenic surrounding in the backdrop of thick forest cover</p>

        <p>The scheme was suggested by Pandurangrrao Krishnajirao Shinde, Esqr, BA, I.S.E ref to Report of Examination, by Sir Henry Howard, O.I.E, M.C., M Inst.C.E., M. I. E.E.. Considering the suggested advantage towards increasing irrigated land up to 15000 hectares and satisfying Kolhapur municipal water requirement, the share capital raised was paid back to concerned share holders who had planned for thermo-electric (by letting all water into Konkan for electricity generation) and mining project.
            Because of Mr Shinde's suggestion, the scheme was handed over to government in interest of people, after the capital invested was realised. (Ref report by Henry Howard)
            Scheme was approved by Rajaram Maharaj or else would have been a thermal electric project, in favour of British industrial syndicate as suggested in the Second opinion of Sir Vishveswarayya.
